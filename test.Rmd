## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Setting up the order of wells
library(reshape2)

rows <- LETTERS[1:16]
columns <- 1:24
samples <- matrix(ncol= length(columns), nrow = length(rows), NA)
colnames(samples) <- columns
rownames(samples) <- rows
pre_neat <- paste0(melt(samples)$Var1, melt(samples)$Var2)
neat <- rep(pre_neat, each = 2)
neat_2 <- paste(neat,rep(c("JOE","FAM"), times = 384), sep = "_")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
