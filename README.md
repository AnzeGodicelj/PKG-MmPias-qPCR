# PKG-MmPias-qPCR
This is preliminary analysis of MmPias3 expression in EMT6 cell line. Initially, the MmPias3 was overexpressed from EF1a promoter, but the expresssion far exceeded our goals. Therefore, we switched EF1a promoter for much weaker PKG promoter. This gave much more appropriate overexpression of MmPias3 (10- to 30-fold overexpression).
